### Instructions to Run the Project

To run this project on your Laptop/PC, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install Python from the official website.

2. **Face Recognition Setup**:
   - We use face recognition for client authentication with Python in C# using the `python.net` library.
   - We employ the DeepFace library with Google FaceNet models for face recognition.
   
3. **Copy Python Codes**:
   - Copy the two Python code files provided in the repository folder named `Python Codes`.
   - Paste these files in the following directory: `C:\Program Files\Python312\Lib`.

4. **Install DeepFace Library**:
   - Open Command Prompt and run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install deepface
     ```
   - Remember that when you run a code using Deepface for the first time on your laptop/PC, it needs to download the respective model. For example, if you are using the FaceNet model, it will take some time to download the model the first time you run the face recognition code.

5. **Database Access via Azure**:
   - We use an Azure server with our SQL Server database.
   - Share your internet IP address with me at `mannanulhaq2004@gmail.com`.
   - I will decide whether to grant you access. Without access, you can only review the code but cannot run it.

6. **Run the Code**:
   - After completing the above steps, you should be able to run the project code on your system.
